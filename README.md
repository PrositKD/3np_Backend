# 3np_Backend
3NP Backend REST API with PostgreSQL (Advanced WebTech Course)
This project, "3NP Backend REST API," is part of an Advanced Web Technologies course, implemented using TypeScript, Nest.js, and PostgreSQL. The backend server serves as the core infrastructure for the 3NP application, providing a RESTful API to handle requests, manage data, and facilitate communication with the frontend while utilizing PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Key Features
RESTful API Endpoints: Implement crucial API endpoints adhering to RESTful principles for various functionalities in the 3NP application, such as user management, data retrieval, and processing.

Database Integration: Integrate PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database, to efficiently store and retrieve data needed for the application.

Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and control access to protected routes.

Error Handling: Develop robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to clients.

Middleware and Request Processing: Utilize middleware to process incoming requests, validate inputs, and streamline the request-response cycle.

Technologies Used
TypeScript: The primary language for developing the backend, offering strong typing and enhanced developer productivity.

Node.js: The runtime environment that enables running TypeScript on the server-side.



PostgreSQL: A powerful and efficient open-source relational database used to store and manage application data.

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
