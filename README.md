# 3np_Backend
3NP Backend (Advanced WebTech Course)
This project, "3NP Backend," is part of an Advanced Web Technologies course, implemented using TypeScript and Next.js. The backend server serves as the core infrastructure for the 3NP application, handling requests, managing data, and facilitating communication with the frontend.

Key Features
API Endpoints: Implement crucial APIs for various functionalities in the 3NP application, such as user management, data retrieval, and processing.

Database Integration: Integrate a database system to efficiently store and retrieve data needed for the application.

Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and control access to protected routes.

Error Handling: Develop robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and provide meaningful feedback to clients.

Middleware and Request Processing: Utilize middleware to process incoming requests, validate inputs, and streamline the request-response cycle.

Technologies Used
TypeScript: The primary language for developing the backend, offering strong typing and enhanced developer productivity.

Node.js: The runtime environment that enables running TypeScript on the server-side.

Next.js: A popular framework for server-rendered React applications, used here to build the backend server and handle API requests.

Database (postgreSQL): An efficient and scalable database to manage application data.

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Configure the database settings in the appropriate configuration files.
Run the server using npm run dev.
